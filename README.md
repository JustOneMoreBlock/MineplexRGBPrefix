There is no 1.8.9 for Macro Keybind Mod.

While this doesn't affect gameplay. I don't see it as a bannable offense and that's why I don't use it. This was simply for testing purposes only.

Once installed you simply place the text file into your `.minecraft/mods/macro/` as `rgbprefix.txt` and make keybind for it.

- Press ~ (Tilday Key)
- Click on the `A`.
- Select a key, I used `Home` for testing.
- In the input field.

```
$$<rgbprefix.txt>
```
